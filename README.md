## Ramp Up Predictive Model
### 📌Overview:
This model forecasts ramp-up events in the UK Power Market using real-time and historical market signals.  A ramp-up(/down) or 'trip' is defined as a significant increase (or decrease) in the level of output of a company's products or services. The objective is to anticipate volatility in demand/supply to aid algorithmic trading decisions.

### 🧠 Key Concepts used within this project:
- Machine Learning forecasting
- Time-series regression
- Energy demand modelling

### ⚒️ Tech Stack:
- Python, SQL, Git, Databricks
- Libraries: pandas,  sckit-learn, matplotlib

### 📂 Repository Structure:

Below is the repository structure that outlines the core details of this project. Raw data is obtained from the [National Grid ESO Data Portal](https://data.nationalgrideso.com) which provides demand forecasts and generation by fuel type to evaluate system demands and forecasting peak loads based on the time and day. The file formats are in CSV and are free to access for whoever views this README.md.
