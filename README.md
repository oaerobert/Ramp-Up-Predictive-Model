# Ramp-Up-Predictive-Model
This project builds a predictive model to estimate ramp-up events in the UK GB Power Market using real-time and historical market data. The aim is to anticipate sudden spikes in energy demand or supply to enable more efficient trading. This is a simplified, anonymized and simulated version of the project, completed during my internship.
